# Dal Nirvana (boil)

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dry brown lentils 
- 15 oz can crushed or diced tomatoes 
- 2 cloves garlic 
- 1 inch fresh ginger 
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 
- 1/2 tsp cumin 
- 2 Tbsp butter 
- to taste salt and pepper 
- 1/2 cup evaporated milk or cream 
- 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro 

## Instructions

- Place the lentils in a pot and cover with a couple inches of water. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until tender (about ten minutes). Drain the lentils in a colander.

- While the lentils are boiling, mince the garlic and peel and grate the ginger (use a small cheese grater). Return the drained lentils to the pot (medium heat) and add the butter, ginger, garlic, cayenne, cumin, salt and pepper.

- Add the can of tomatoes and one cup of water. Stir it all together, bring it to a simmer then reduce the heat to low. Put a lid on the pot and let it simmer for half an hour. The mixture should be soft and thick after a half hour. If it is not, continue to simmer, adding more water if it dries out. You want the end product to be thick, not watery.

- Stir in the evaporated milk or cream and garnish with fresh, chopped cilantro. Serve over rice or with naan bread for dipping!
