# Falafel

## Ingredients

- 2 15 oz cans chickpeas 
- 1/4 red onion 
- 1 handfull fresh parsley (about 1/4 bunch) 
- 4 cloves garlic 
- 1 tsp salt 
- 1/2 tsp cayenne 
- 1 tsp cumin 
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup flour (chickpea preferred, all purpose is fine)
- 1/4 cup neutral cooking oil for frying 

## Instructions

- Rinse and drain the chickpeas in a colander. Add the chickpeas to a food processor along with the red onion, parsley, cilantro, salt, cayenne, garlic and cumin (all ingredients except baking powder and flour). Process the mixture until it forms a chunky paste. A little texture to the mixture is usually desirable. You may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally to make sure the mixture is an even texture.

- Place the mixture into a bowl and stir in the baking powder. Begin adding flour, 2 Tbsp at a time, until the mixture becomes cohesive enough to form into patties. Refrigerate the mixture for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend.

- Using a small measuring cup or scoop (about 1/8th cup or 2 Tbsp), form the falafel dough into small patties. If freezing the patties for later, place them on a parchment lined baking sheet so they can freeze without sticking together. The patties can be transferred to an air-tight container or freezer bag for long-term storage once they have frozen through.

- To cook the fresh or frozen patties, heat oil in a skillet (or pot if deep frying) until very hot and shimmering, but not smoking. Cook the patties on each side until deep golden brown and crispy.
